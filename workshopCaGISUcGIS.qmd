# Get world map data from Natural Earth
world <- ne_countries(scale = 'medium', type = 'map_units', returnclass = 'sf')

# Transform the CRS to Mollweide projection (EPSG: 54009)
world_mollweide <- st_transform(world, crs = '+proj=moll +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs')

# Define graticule lines
graticule <- st_graticule(world_mollweide, densify = 0.1) # may need adjustment for density

# Load cities from a CSV file

# Convert the data frame to an 'sf' object
cities_sf <- st_as_sf(cities_csv, coords = c('lon', 'lat'), crs = 4326)

# Transform cities to Mollweide projection

knitr::include_graphics("imgs/process.png")

## Type of papers
- <span style="color: green;">research (most common)</span> 
- <span style="color: red;">review</span> 
- <span style="color: blue;">essay/vision </span> 

## <span style="color: green;">The structure of your paper (research)</span> 
- *Title/abstract/keywords*
- *Introduction*:  introduce the problem and motivate your paper
  - why do we need this type of research
  - contributions to existing work in the journal or nearby outlets
- A well explained methodology, with testable hypothesis
- New method (e.g. color scheme) --> surveys with subjects
- *Discuss your results* (have stakeholders been involved?)
- Future research

## <span style="color: green;">Testing with participants</span> 
- Typically in the US, needs to go through IRB
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A study on the aptitude of color hue, value, and transparency for geographic relevance encoding in mobile maps. CaGIS 2023", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/participants.png")
```

## <span style="color: red;">The structure of your paper (review)</span> 
- Title/abstract/keywords
- Introduction:  introduce the problem and motivate your paper
  - why do we need this review?
    - is the field moving quickly?
    - is it part of a Ph.D. student first chapter?
- How is the review conducted? PubMed, Google Search?
- Future directions / call for research


## <span style="color: red;">The structure of your paper (review)</span> 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Example of a literature review/essay", out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/lit-review.png")
```
## Lines between essays and reviews are blurry 
- Senior scientists or rapidly emerging scholars are likely to submit essays.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/trustinmaps.png")
```


## <span style="color: blue;">The structure of your paper (essay)</span> 
- You will need some lit. review to ground your research
- Approach could be:
  - Analytical and Reflective on different perspectives, theories
  - Argumentative: present or defend a particular argument or viewpoint
  - Critical Evaluation: evaluate existing knowledge, identifying gaps, inconsistencies, or areas needing further research.
  - Theoretical Focus: exploring conceptual frameworks and their implications.
- Directions for research

## The order of authors is important
- Generally, the individual who conducted the majority of the work, should be first.
- However, in some domains (public health) the adviser goes last.
- Sandwich authors when contribution is limited
- Removing authors on R1, R2 is not a good strategy
- Author for correspondance


## What is Reproducibility & Replicability?
*When the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset produce the same answer.* ([Turing
Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions))

## How do we make our research reproducible? - **FAIR**:
::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Findable**
  - Descriptive metadata and persistent identifier (DOI)

- **Accessible**
  - Code/data could be openly available OR access via authentication and if needed

- **Interoperable**
  - Data needs to be integrated with other data and interoperate with applications or workflows (Open formats)

- **Reusable**
  - Documentation and license (Open license - e.g. Creative Commons)

## R&R (again)
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/reproducibleResearch.png")
```

## Codes!

  - Some journals & conferences ask you to submit code along with your paper
  - Anyone (with a similar level of skills) should be able to do reproduce your research and benefit from it. 
  - If you do analysis in ArcGIS Pro, you need ArcGIS Pro to recreate that analysis
  - If you don't have ArcGIS Pro, what do you do?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/phdComic.png")
```

## Preparing flowcharts (1/3)
- Importance of replicability; a flowchart can really help.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/flowchart.png")
```

## Preparing flowcharts (2/3)
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/flowchartB.png")
```

## Preparing flowcharts (3/3)
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/flowchartc.png")
```

## Preparing maps (1/2)
- Figures should be in TIFF or EPS format. 
  - Formats such as GIF, JPEG, PDF are not acceptable
  - Images produced in or embedded in PowerPoint / Word not acceptable
- Resolution must be 600 dpi.


## Preparing maps (2/2
- Multipart figures should be labelled a), b), c), etc. T
- Do not embed captions within the figure
- When exporting to EPS or TIFF, all fonts should be embedded
- **Myriad Pro** (sans serif) font is used for figure captions 
- All figures can be color (there is no additional charge for color)

## Example (how to improve?) ($\frac{1}{2}$)
```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/mapsNotGreat.png")
```
[Map Doctor](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-14WuzVoyJ-map-doctor)
[Guide, Journal of Maps](https://files.taylorandfrancis.com/TJOM-suppmaterial-quick-guide.pdf)

## Example (how to improve?) ($\frac{2}{2}$)
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/mapsCouldbeBetter.png")
```


## Maps - example of effective design  ($\frac{1}{3}$)
```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/MapsSimple.png")
```

## Maps - example of effective design  ($\frac{2}{3}$)
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/MapsSimpleC.png")
```

## Maps - example of effective design  ($\frac{3}{3}$)
```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/SimpleStraightoThePoint.png")
```


## Graphs: Simplify!
- Franconeri, Steven L., et al. "The science of visual data communication: What works." Psychological Science in the public interest 22.3 (2021): 110-161.
```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/scienceOfVisualData.png")
```

## Graphs:focus on which message?
```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/effectiveGraph.png")
```

## Graphs: Scale axis
- Message will be different depending on (a) how you present your data
 and (b) your audience
```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/effectiveGraphB.png")
```

## Graphs: simplify clutter
- many package in R allow you to 'declutter' your data
```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/improveGraph.png")
```

## Graphs: Be effective
```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/effectiveGraphsC.png")
```

## Graphs: Test is your friend
```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/effectiveGraphD.png")
```

## Graphs: very effective
```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/johnBurnFT.png")
```

## Thoughts on Colors
- Use Sparingly – don’t lose preattentive attribute.
- Use Consistently – don’t change because you are bored.
- Design with colorblind in mind – 8% of men, 0.5 % women. (red/green)
  - ([color brewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3))
  - ([tristen](http://tristen.ca/hcl-picker/#/hlc/6/1/15534C/CB6C79))

- Thoughtful of tone color conveys
  - ([information is beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/colours-in-cultures/))
